<p>This HTML5 Flexible template could be a good starting point for some of your projects.  The template file starts by setting a background color on the HTML element, and setting max-width on the body, which is styled like a wrapper.  The BODY element is also set to a percentage width so it leaves a bit of HTML color until it shrinks in size toward the mobile view.</p>
<p>There is an image with a class of FLEXIBLE which is set to a max-width equal to the size of the image.  Simutaneously the class sets the image to a percentage width, allowing the image to flex in size.  The height is not changed, as this would skew the image.</p>
<p>The LIST elements inside the NAV are displayed inline by setting the display to be inline-block.  Bullets are removed by setting the UL to display</p>
<p>The FOOTER includes a clear:both to keep everything above it!</p>
 <img src="images/afternoon.jpg" alt="time of day pic" id="myPic" class="flexible" />
